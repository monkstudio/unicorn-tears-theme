# Features

### Social media menu
You can build a social menu by making a new menu in the Appearance editor, and assigning it to the Social menu using custom links. Any links related to social medias will automically be converted to inline svg social icons. Any unrecognized networks will show a chain icon. New social icons can be added in `inc/class-svg-icons.php`.

---

### Inline svg icon functions
Commonly used SVG icons can now be called by the function `get_icon('$icon, $size, $class, $title, $desc')`.

** `get_icon()` or  `get_social_icon()` parameters:**
- `$svgname` = name of svg defined in the array (required)
- `$size` = size of svg required (required)
- `class` = icon class (optional)
- `$title = SVG title (optional)
- `$desc` = SVG description (optional)
eg `<?php echo get_icon('arrow',20,'arrow-icon','arrow');?>`
eg. <?php echo get_social_icon('instagram',20,'ig');?>

Alternatively you can use, `get_social_link_svg()` to display a svg based on a given social media url. New icons can be defined in `inc/class-svg-icons.php`

**`get_social_link_svg()` parameters:**
- `$uri` = url of social network (required)
- `$size` = size of svg required (required)
- `class` = icon class (optional)
- `$wrap_link` = wrap displayed svg with the given url  (optional)
- `$title = SVG title (optional)
- `$desc` = SVG description (optional)

eg `<?php echo get_social_link_svg('https://facebook.com',20,'fb',false,'Facebook');?>`
Custom SVGs can be defined as inline svg's in the relevant array in `inc/class-svg-icons.php`

### Responsive menus

There are several predefined menu classes you can use for the nav menu (found in _menus.scss).
To use include the relevant class to `.menu-wrapper` in the header and compile the associated sass file.

---

### Page layouts

Page layouts are based on ACF Pro custom fields.
---

### Favicons
Favicons will be created automatically if there is a `favicon.png` placed in `src/images` (but will have to be manually linked in the header).
