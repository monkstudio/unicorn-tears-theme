# Features

### Social media menu
You can build a social menu by making a new menu in the Appearance editor, and assigning it to the Social menu using custom links. Any links related to social medias will automically be converted to inline svg social icons. Any unrecognized networks will show a chain icon.

---

### Inline svg icon functions
Commonly used SVG icons can now be called by the function `get_icon('$svgname, $size, $title, $desc')`.

** `get_icon()` or  `get_social_icon()` parameters:**
- `$svgname` = name of svg defined in the array
- `$size` = size of svg required
- `$title = SVG title (makes it more accessible)
- `$desc` = SVG description ( makes it more accessible)

Alternatively you can use, `get_social_link_svg()` to display a svg based on a given url.

**` get_social_link_svg()` parameters:**
- `$uri` = url of social network
- `$size` = size of svg required
- `$wrap_link` = wrap displayed svg with the given url
- `$title = SVG title (makes it more accessible)
- `$desc` = SVG description ( makes it more accessible)

Custom SVGs can be defined as inline svg's in the relevant array in `inc/class-svg-icons.php`

---

### Responsive menus

There are several predefined menu classes you can use for the nav menu. Just add the relevant class to `.menu-wrapper` in the header.

---

### Page layouts

Page layouts are based on ACF's custom fields. Custom ones can be added accordingly.

---

### Favicons
Favicons can be generated automatically and put in the /dist folder if there is a `favicon.png` placed in `src/images`
